	p "My inspiration for the 'Colorful History' series came to me after I moved back to my home town of San Francisco after living abroad for some years. While living in New York City, around 2004, I created a number of paintings that I called the 'Vanishing Landscape' series. These paintings used the same painting and photo transfer technique of the 'Colorful History' series, but with my own photographs.
	p While it wasn't quite clear when 'modernity' begins or what it really implies, the invention of photography certainly had something to do with it, at least in the world of western art. With photography being the beginning of 'modernity' in art, then painting in the 2010's has to be somewhere near the end, it felt interesting for me to make work that drew from both ends of this spectrum. Hard to say where we are in the span of 'modernity', because it will be interesting what they will call what comes after 'post contemporary', perhaps 'post modernity'?"
